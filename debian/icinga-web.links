# links for nagios-images
# due to compatibility with source installs we have to link each logo pack
# and are not able to just use the full logos path, pathing won't be easy
# because the paths are referenced via: /icinga-web/images/icinga/<logopath>
# and /icinga-web/images/icinga contains other stuff
