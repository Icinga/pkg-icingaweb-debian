Description: host and network monitoring system - modern web interface
 Icinga is a modular monitoring framework for hosts, services, and
 networks, based on the Nagios project. It is designed to be easy to
 understand and modify to fit any need.
 .
 Features include:
  * monitoring of network services via ping, SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, or
    TCP port;
  * plugin interface to allow for user-developed service checks;
  * contact notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via
    email, pager, or user-defined method)
  * support for proactive problem resolution (handlers can be defined to
    be run during service or host events);
  * web output: current status, notifications, problem history, log
    file, etc.
 .
 This package provides the new web interface to view Icinga monitoring
 results and send commands to the Icinga Core. Host and service status,
 history, notifications and status maps are available to keep a check on
 the health of your network in real time.
